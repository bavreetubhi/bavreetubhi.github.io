      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        For Solaris MkIII, the combustion chamber and nozzle had to withstand long burn times and high
        chamber pressures while keeping mass and manufacturing complexity under control. I led the
        design and CAD of a regeneratively cooled nozzle intended for metal additive manufacturing,
        replacing a conventional ablative insert with an actively cooled, reusable component.
      </p>

      <p>
        The nozzle integrates internal cooling channels, structural support ribs and mounting interfaces
        into a single printed part. The geometry was iterated alongside in-house performance simulations
        and cooling analysis to keep wall temperatures within material limits while maintaining an efficient
        expansion contour.

       REGEN COOLING CONCEPT
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content slide-section">

      <h2>Regenerative Cooling Concept</h2>

      <p>
        The nozzle uses a network of axial and circumferential cooling channels wrapped around the
        throat region, where heat fluxes are highest. Coolant enters upstream, passes through channels
        close to the hot-gas wall, and exits at the nozzle exit plane, extracting heat while preheating the
        working fluid.
      </p>

      <p>
        The channel layout was explored parametrically in CAD, balancing pressure drop, flow distribution
        and local wall thickness. High curvature regions near the throat were given higher channel density,
        while the bell section uses longer, smoother channels to limit pressure losses.

      <h2>Geometry &amp; CAD Implementation</h2>

      <p>
        The nozzle contour is based on an axisymmetric bell profile matched to the engine operating point.
        The CAD model parametrically links key dimensions such as throat radius, expansion ratio and
        wall thickness, making it straightforward to re-run analyses when the engine configuration changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cooling channels were modelled as swept cuts following guide curves around the contour. Ribs and
        outer jackets were then built around these channels to provide stiffness and external connection
        surfaces. Particular attention was paid to transitions at the throat band and at the inlet and outlet
        manifolds to avoid sharp corners that are difficult to print and inspect.

      <h2>Thermal &amp; Structural Analysis</h2>

      <p>
        Heat flux distributions from engine-level analysis were mapped onto the nozzle inner wall and
        used as inputs for thermal simulations. The cooling channels were approximated as internal
        convection boundaries with film coefficients estimated from coolant flow conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Resulting wall temperature fields were then combined with internal pressure loads and external
        constraints for structural analysis. This checked both local stress levels in the thin throat region and
        global stiffness for integration with the rest of the engine.

       MANUFACTURING STRATEGY
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content alt slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in right">

      <h2>Manufacturing Strategy</h2>

      <p>
        From the outset the geometry was constrained by metal additive manufacturing rules: minimum
        channel diameters, overhang limits, powder removal paths and build orientation were all considered
        while modelling. The nozzle body is designed to be printed as a single piece, with supports located
        away from critical sealing and flow surfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Internal powder removal is enabled by manifolds and access ports at inlet and outlet plenums. Wall
        thicknesses and rib spacing were tuned to avoid large unsupported spans and to keep print time and
        cost reasonable while still taking advantage of the design freedom offered by AM.
