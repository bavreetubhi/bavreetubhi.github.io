       OVERVIEW
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in">

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        This project started with a real problem in a home garage workshop: tools and equipment were
        stored on the floor, there was no dedicated workspace, and no organised storage for day-to-day
        making and repairs. The solution was a purpose-built workbench designed to be strong, portable,
        and long-lasting — with an emphasis on clean aesthetics and workshop practicality.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final design combines a large work surface, symmetrical shelving, and multiple drawer heights
        so small parts and bulky tools can be stored separately. A key feature is a replaceable top system:
        the bench is built to take real abuse, but the wear surfaces are designed to be swapped when damaged.
      </p>

       END USER + PROBLEM
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content alt slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in right">

      <h2>End User &amp; Problem Definition</h2>

      <p>
        The end user was defined as a 16-year-old student who enjoys building items out of wood and other
        materials. He works casually (café + cleaning), has a stable income for a student, and spends a lot
        of time creating projects — but his garage environment had no proper work zone or storage system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main pain points were:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tools and equipment on the floor with no dedicated storage</li>
        <li>No large, stable surface to build on for long sessions</li>
        <li>Needs portability (moving house / repositioning in garage)</li>
        <li>Needs the bench to look clean and modern (dark timber contrast preferred)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To solve this, the bench was designed with extra support members to reduce break points, wheels
        for mobility, and a replaceable tabletop system so damage doesn’t end the product’s life.
      </p>

    </div>

  <!-- ============================
       SPECIFICATIONS + CONSTRAINTS
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in">

      <h2>Specifications &amp; Constraints</h2>

      <p>
        The project had clear dimensional targets to ensure the bench fit the garage and was comfortable
        to use:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Length:</strong> ~2000 mm</li>
        <li><strong>Width:</strong> ~800 mm</li>
        <li><strong>Height:</strong> ~900 mm</li>
        <li><strong>Top overhang:</strong> ~25 mm on all sides</li>
        <li><strong>Corner safety:</strong> curved corners to reduce hazards</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Primary constraints:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Must be sturdy enough to handle impacts and tool damage</li>
        <li>Must be movable (portable around the garage)</li>
        <li>Must have a replaceable tabletop</li>
        <li>Must fit well in the garage</li>
        <li><strong>Budget:</strong> cannot exceed $500</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additional considerations were included to raise functionality and finish quality:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Incorporate a sturdy built-in light</li>
        <li>Built-in magnetic tray for screws / small metal parts</li>
        <li>Finish before exams (project scheduling constraint)</li>
        <li><strong>Quality tolerance target:</strong> ±5 mm precision on parts</li>
        <li>Should look good (clean, modern aesthetic)</li>
      </ul>

    </div>

       FUNCTION + DESIGN PRIORITY
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content alt slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in right">

      <h2>Function, Priority &amp; Product Design Factors</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Primary function:</strong> a stable working surface for building, repairs, and general workshop tasks.
        <br />
        <strong>Secondary function:</strong> organised storage and protection for tools and equipment when not in use.
      </p>

      <p>
        The design priority was durability: the bench must resist sudden impacts (hammer strikes, dropped tools,
        general workshop abuse) and remain safe and usable over extended periods.

    <div class="project-inner slide-in right">

      <h2>Production Planning</h2>

      <p>
        Production was planned using a materials cutting list and a sequenced process table including
        tools/equipment, safety precautions, and estimated time per step. This was used to control accuracy
        and reduce rework.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cutting list covered major components including MDF top, pine legs, top supports, shelves,
        and drawer parts (fronts + internal pieces), ensuring the build could be completed inside budget.
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/projects/Workbench/cutting_list.jpg"
           alt="Materials cutting list"
           class="project-image-large" />

      <p>
        The sequence plan included the full workflow: measuring and marking, cutting, domino joinery,
        glue-up/clamping, sanding, assembly, routing, and final drawer runner installation.

      <p>
        A risk assessment was produced for key workshop processes including routing, drilling, table saw,
        and mitre saw operations. Hazards included entanglement, tool jamming/binding, dust/splinters,
        electric shock, burns from hot drill bits, and trips from cords across walkways.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Secure loose clothing, jewellery, and tie back long hair</li>
        <li>Eye and hearing protection during machining</li>
        <li>Clamp workpieces before drilling/routing</li>
        <li>Keep cords taped down or routed above bench height</li>
        <li>Avoid using electrical tools near water</li>

        A care label was produced to support long-term durability:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep the bench in a <strong>dry environment</strong> — pine can warp when overexposed to water</li>
        <li>If wet, wipe water off immediately with a dry rag</li>
        <li>Periodically check the top for water damage or swelling</li>
        <li>Replace the MDF top / hardwood brim when wear becomes significant</li>

        This project demonstrates a complete product design workflow:
        user profiling → constraints/specs → concept evaluation → production planning → safe fabrication →
        and criteria-based validation. The final bench delivered the core goals: a strong work surface,
        organised storage, and maintainable wear components designed for long-term workshop use.
