      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        This project was a full design-to-build workbench developed around a clear user problem:
        tools and equipment were being stored on the garage floor with no dedicated workspace or
        storage system. The goal was to design a workbench that is durable, clean-looking, portable,
        and highly functional for woodworking and general making.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final bench combines a large working surface with multi-height drawers and open shelving,
        and uses a replaceable MDF top with a hardwood protective brim for longevity. The design was
        constrained by a sub-$500 budget and a build tolerance target of ±5&nbsp;mm. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

       DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content alt slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in right">

      <h2>Design Brief &amp; Requirements</h2>

      <p>
        The bench was designed for a garage environment and long work sessions, with an emphasis on
        strength, safety, and usability. Key requirements included:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> withstand impacts and workshop use without damage</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> castors for maneuverability and future house moves</li>
        <li><strong>Replaceable top:</strong> removable MDF surface for easy maintenance</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> multiple drawers + shelves for organised tools/materials</li>
        <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> clean, modern look (dark timber contrast preferred)</li>
        <li><strong>Budget:</strong> total cost &lt; $500</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Safety and ergonomics were also built in via rounded corners, a fully sanded finish, and
        workshop-appropriate working height. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

      <h2>Concept Development &amp; Selection</h2>

      <p>
        Three design options were evaluated against the project criteria (strength, portability,
        interchangeable top, sustainability, and garage fit). Option 1 scored highest and was selected
        due to its balanced layout and functionality. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

             class="project-image-half" />
      </div>

      <p>
        The preferred option includes a drawer stack for small-item organisation, open shelves for
        larger items, and a replaceable top system supported by a robust pine structure.

    <div class="project-inner slide-in right">

      <h2>Final Design &amp; Features</h2>

      <p>
        The final bench uses a light-coloured pine frame paired with a darker hardwood perimeter
        (brim) around the MDF top to protect high-wear edges and create a clean contrasting finish.
        Drawers use runners for smooth operation, and cut-out drawer pulls keep the front profile
        simple and snag-free. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

      <p>
        The bench was designed around accessible, cost-effective materials and strong joinery.
        Pine was chosen for the main structure, MDF for the replaceable top, and hardwood for the
        perimeter wear surface. Assembly used dominos, glue, nails, and screws in a process focused
        on strength, accuracy, and repeatability. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

        A risk assessment and quality management plan were used to control tool safety and accuracy.

        The bench was evaluated against the original criteria: strength, portability, replaceable top,

        construction, and verifying the removable top system and dimensional fit. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> tested with tools and real workshop use; remained sturdy</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> heavy without castors, designed to roll easily once installed</li>
        <li><strong>Replaceable top:</strong> removable but heavy; future improvement: lighter internal frame</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> low waste; offcuts reused for jigs</li>
        <li><strong>Garage fit:</strong> final dimensions matched the available space</li>
