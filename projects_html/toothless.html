      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Toothless is a Level 2 high-power rocket designed as a testbed for custom airframe and propulsion
        hardware. I was responsible for the entire airframe, from CAD through to manufacturing, including a
        3D printed and fibreglass-reinforced nose cone, carbon fibre airframe tube, carbon fibre wrapped
        plywood fins, and a custom SRAD hybrid rocket engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal was to build a structurally efficient, re-usable platform that could carry the hybrid engine
        and avionics stack safely through boost, coast and recovery while demonstrating reliable composite
        manufacturing and integration at the L2 scale.

      <p>
        The airframe was designed around a modular layout: nose cone, main carbon fibre body tube, fin
        can, and separate avionics bay. This made it easier to iterate on individual components without
        rebuilding the entire rocket.

      <h2>Nose Cone Design &amp; Build</h2>

      <p>
        The nose cone started as a 3D CAD model sized to match the rocket diameter and desired ogive /
        profile. The core was 3D printed in segments, then joined, sanded and filled to create a smooth plug
        for glassing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Multiple layers of fibreglass were applied with epoxy to create a tough, impact resistant shell. The
        internal volume was reserved for future payloads or tracker hardware, and a bulkhead was added at
        the shoulder to interface with the recovery system.

      <h2>Carbon Fibre Tube &amp; Fins</h2>

      <p>
        The main body tube was produced by laying up carbon fibre over a cylindrical mandrel. The layup
        schedule was selected to give sufficient bending stiffness for L2 loads while keeping the wall thin
        enough to save mass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fins were cut from plywood, profiled and then wrapped in carbon fibre to improve stiffness and edge
        durability. A through-the-wall design tied the fins into the internal motor mount tube to create a
        robust load path from aerodynamic forces into the airframe.

      <h2>SRAD Hybrid Rocket Engine</h2>

      <p>
        Toothless was powered by a custom student-researched and developed hybrid engine. The design
        pulled together injector, combustion chamber, grain geometry and nozzle into a single integrated
        package sized for a Level 2 flight envelope.
      </p>

      <p>
        The engine was designed around a safe oxidiser flow rate, regression rate estimates and thrust
        requirements for the chosen airframe and launch site constraints. Particular care was taken with
        ignition strategy, sealing and mounting hardware.

      <h2>Integration &amp; Avionics</h2>

      <p>
        The airframe, engine and avionics were integrated through a central motor mount and removable
        avionics bay. The bay held the flight computer, power system and wiring for pyro channels and
        tracking, with access ports to arm the system on the pad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Internal structure was arranged so that thrust, fin loads and recovery forces were all transmitted
        along clear, reinforced paths, reducing the chance of local failures during boost or deployment.

      <p>
        Before flying, the airframe and recovery system were ground tested, including harness tests, ejection
        charge verification and fit checks of all sections. The hybrid engine underwent separate subsystem
        checks for plumbing and ignition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Toothless was then flown as an L2 vehicle, validating the composite airframe, fin can and nose cone,
        as well as demonstrating the integration of a custom SRAD hybrid on a student-built platform.

      <p>
        Toothless consolidated a full stack of skills: 3D CAD, composite manufacturing, hybrid engine design
        and high-power rocketry integration. Building the rocket from the nose cone down to the fin can and
        propulsion system gave a much deeper understanding of how each subsystem affects reliability and
        performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project also provided a stepping stone towards more advanced composite airframes and hybrid
        propulsion work at higher altitudes and larger scales.
