      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        While working the combustion chamber for MkIII one onf the most tedious steps was trying
        to optimize the layup, this included number of layers, material, angles & thickness. With
        so many variables and very limited time to validate the stackups there were countless late
        nights and early mornings to try optimize the COPV.
      </p>

      <p>
        To try combat this I've been further progressing the capabilities of a In house Layup analysis
        script initially written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-russell-40016566/">Thomas Russell</a>.
        I took it upon my self to fully flush out and optimize the code implementing features and
        simplifying the user experience to ensure it could be used even after I leave the team.

        The GUI is still being worked on but the actual back end math is compleated and full running, 
        able to output results for a single vessel or run a sweep through many different variables and
        picking the best result for each step.

      <p>
        The wall structure is a multi-material laminate designed for hoop strength, thermal
        isolation, and manufacturability using university workshop tooling, composites workshop and the teams accsess to composite materials. 
        The baseline layup is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>1 × inner fibreglass ply providing thermal protection and leak resistance</li>
        <li>11 × 0/90 carbon-fibre 3k twill plies carrying the primary hoop and axial load</li>
        <li>1 × external carbon-fibre sleeve for abrasion resistance</li>
        <li>Al7075-T6 threaded couplers bonded into the laminate during curing</li>

        the chamber is constructed as one monolithic piece to maximise composite stregnth with bonded couplers at each end to interface with the injector and nozzle. 
        The internal fibreglass layer acts as a thermal barrier and sacriffical  layer to prevent the high combustion temperatures from degrading the carbon fibre resin matrix.
        while the external sleeve protects against handling damage during assembly and transport.

       MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in">

      <h2>Manufacturing Development &amp; Process</h2>

      <p>
        Developing a repeatable manufacturing method for a Type-V combustion chamber required several
        iterations. I progressed through four main prototype approaches, starting with simple
        heatshrink-only consolidation and evolving towards a full vacuum-bagged, heat-treated process
        using Technirez R2600 / H2409 high-temperature resin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early tubes used a fibreglass wet layup with heatshrink consolidation,
        which caused fibre wrinkling and resin pooling. Doughnut-style vacuum bagging improved
        cosmetic finish but produced soft, leaking laminates. Through later attempts I converged on a
        hybrid process: vacuum-bagged fibreglass liner, carbon fibre overwrap, and controlled
        heatshrink compression.
      </p>

      <p>
        This informed the final large-scale workflow involving proper mandrel prep, Resin Pre-Coat
        (RPC) bonding of aluminium couplers, a staged composite layup, and a multi-step thermal cure
        out to 200&nbsp;°C.

       STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE

  <section class="project-content alt slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in right">

      <h2>Structural Performance</h2>

      <p>
        The chamber wall was analysed using ANSYS (ACP + Static
        Structural). Ply-level orthotropic modelling confirmed that the laminate maintains a
        Factor of Safety above 3 at peak operating pressure. Interface stresses at
        the couplers were examined to ensure the preferred failure mode is thread shear rather than
        COPV rupture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sub-scale burst tests closely matched simulation predictions and validated the manufacturing
        approach, shrink-tape consolidation, and R2600 resin cure schedule. Full-scale proof testing
        will confirm the chamber is leak-tight and structurally sound to 1.5× MEOP, this is currently in progress.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        The Solaris MkIII composite combustion chamber represents a significant advance in the team's
        capability. The Type-V COPV architecture delivers high structural performance with minimal
        mass, while the manufacturing workflow developed for this project forms the basis for future
        high-pressure propulsion hardware.
        <br><br>    
        This was a huge learning experience for me as a propulsion engineer, getting to grips with composite design, manufacturing and testing. 
        Leading the development of the first all-composite combustion chamber for the team was a challenging but rewarding experience, 
        and I am proud of the final result which I believe will set a new standard for student rocketry projects.

      <p>
        Some key takeways from this project were the importance of iterative prototyping and testing to refine manufacturing processes,
        as well as the need to balance theoretical design with practical considerations like manufacturability and assembly. But most importantly, 
        the importance of properly machining parts and hitting critical tolerances. 
        unfurtunatly due to time constraints we were unable to machine the couplers to the required tolerances which led to some issues during assembly and a rapid unscheduled disassembly after proof testing at the Airborne test site
        Overall, this project has significantly expanded my skills and knowledge in propulsion engineering and composite materials.
