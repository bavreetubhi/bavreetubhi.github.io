      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        This coffee table was designed as a centrepiece for a family moving into a new home in Highton.
        They wanted a functional table that fits a modern, minimalist interior but also has a feature that
        immediately draws attention when you walk into the room. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The result is a kinetic sand coffee table: a low, rectangular table with storage drawers, a walnut
        top and a CNC-driven metal ball that traces patterns through sand beneath a clear acrylic cover.
        The table balances durability, ergonomics and everyday usability with a visually engaging
        interactive feature.

      <p>
        Early design exploration compared multiple layouts for the sand tray, storage, frame height and
        overall proportions. These iterations helped dial in the balance between visual impact and
        everyday usability. the following images show some of the designs:

      <h2>End Users &amp; Design Brief</h2>

      <p>
        The end users are a family of four plus grandfather, with a strong interest in sport, entertaining
        and modern interior design. They prefer light walls, strong contrast, smooth finishes and high
        quality, durable furniture that can handle everyday use and frequent gatherings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The brief was to produce a coffee table that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Acts as a visual centrepiece in the main living space.</li>
        <li>Matches a contemporary, minimalist aesthetic with timber and steel.</li>
        <li>Includes an engaging interactive feature, not just static décor.</li>
        <li>Provides practical storage and is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
        <li>Is dimensioned ergonomically for comfortable seating around the table.</li>

       DESIGN & INTERACTIVE FEATURE
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content alt slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in">

      <h2>Design &amp; Interactive Feature</h2>

      <p>
        The table is a low, rectangular form with a solid timber top that visually “floats” inside a black
        powder-coated steel frame. The central section of the top is dedicated to the kinetic sand sculptor:
        a shallow tray filled with fine sand, covered by a flush acrylic panel so the surface remains usable
        as a normal coffee table.
      </p>

      <p>
        Underneath the sand tray, a Cartesian gantry moves a powerful magnet in X and Y. On the sand
        surface, a steel ball follows the magnet, carving smooth parametric paths that slowly erase and
        redraw patterns over time. Paths are stored as CNC-style toolpaths and driven by stepper motors
        under microcontroller control.

       MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION
  ============================ -->

    <div class="project-inner slide-in right">

      <h2>Materials &amp; Construction</h2>

      <p>
        The structure combines engineered timber cabinetry with a welded steel frame. Walnut was chosen
        for the visible timber due to its rich grain, durability and premium feel, contrasted against a satin
        black powder-coated steel base. The sand tray is sealed with a bent acrylic cover that improves
        safety compared with glass while keeping the feature clearly visible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Joinery uses dominoes and careful glue-ups to keep faces clean and free of visible fasteners. Twin
        soft-close drawers are integrated into the lower timber volume to provide hidden storage for
        remotes, controllers and other living-room clutter.

      <h2>Material Exploration</h2>

      <p>
        Samples of timber, steel finishes, acrylic thicknesses and different sand types were tested to
        balance durability, appearance and ease of cleaning. The subjective best choices were used in the construction of the table, 
        ensuring the end-users needs were met and the final product was up to their liking.

       ELECTRONICS & MOTION SYSTEM
  ============================ -->
  <section class="project-content slide-section">
    <div class="project-inner slide-in">

      <h2>Electronics &amp; Motion System</h2>

      <p>
        The motion system is built around stepper motors, belt-driven linear rails and an Arduino-based
        GRBL controller. A small computer stores pattern files and streams G-code to the controller, which
        handles homing, coordinated motion and speed control. Early prototypes used high-friction
        aluminium tracks before moving to proper linear rails for smoother, more reliable motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        LED lighting around the sand tray is controlled via a secondary microcontroller, allowing colour
        changes and subtle animations that emphasise the moving sand pattern without overpowering the
        room.

        The table was checked against a detailed evaluation matrix covering size, durability, stability,
        aesthetics, ergonomics and sustainability. Physical testing included spill tests on the top, sanding
        and finishing trials, weld practice coupons, and full motion tests of the CNC system to remove
        stiffness and jamming issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final design scored highest of five options in the evaluation ranking and met the end users’
        expectations for both day-to-day function and standout visual impact in the room.

      <h2>Outcome &amp; Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        The finished kinetic sand coffee table combines furniture design, CNC motion control and product
        development into a single piece of functional furniture. It works as a robust, easy-to-clean coffee
        table with storage, while the kinetic sand sculptor and lighting transform it into a living centrepiece
        when powered on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Building the piece developed my skills across user research, CAD, working drawings, welding,
        advanced timber joinery, electronics integration and scheduling a complex production plan from
        raw stock through to installation in the client’s home.
